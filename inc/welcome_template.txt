[[h2:Welcome to the Mikron Wiki!]]
Mikron is a simple wiki system written in PHP.
It only needs SQLite (v3) to operate, and very little setup (a directory where the web server has write access to store the SQLite database file, and some auth/settings file copies).
If you got this thing from Github, there should be a README.md file with more info.

There isn't much to see here - ''yet''!
