[[h2:Welcome to the Mikron Wiki!]]
Mikron is a simple wiki system written in PHP.
It is a (currently) standalone single-file script that only needs SQLite (v3) to operate and almost zero setup (a directory where the web server has write access to store the SQLite database file).
If you got this thing from Github, there should be a README.md file with more info.

There isn't much to see here - ''yet''!
