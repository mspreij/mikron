This page describes the syntax that Mikron understands for formatting pages.
If it looks weird, try [[html:<a href='?a=view&p=MIKRON_SYNTAX&mikron'>here</a>]].
When making major edits to this page, consider updating the original source version of it in index.php.

[[h1:Paragraphs]]A single paragraph can span multiple lines as long as there isn't an empty line between them.

[[h1:Text formatting]]
[[*]][[*]]Bold text[[*]][[*]] - **bold text**
[[']][[']]Emphasized text[[']][[']] (these are two single quotes) - ''emphasized text''
[[_]][[_]]Underline[[_]][[_]] - __underlined__
[[^]][[^]]Superscript[[^]][[^]] - ^^superscript^^
[[,]][[,]]Subscript[[,]][[,]] - ,,subscript,,
[[~]][[~]]Strikethrough[[~]][[~]] - ~~strikethrough~~
[[%]][[%]]Code/monospaced[[%]][[%]] - %%Code/monospaced iiiWWW%%
---- on a line by itself (no leading/trailing whitespace) to insert a horizontal rule <hr>
[[[]][red]]Lorem Ipsum[[[]][/]]: [[red]]Lorem Ipsum[[/]]. Bunch of color names are available (try and see), 3 or 6 character hex codes are also supported with leading '#'.

[[h1:Headings]]
[[[]][h1:blarg]] for level 1 heading blarg

[[[]][h2:blerg]] for level 2 heading blerg

[[[]][h3:blorg]] for level 3 heading blorg

[[[]][h4:blirg]] for level 4 heading blirg

[[h1:blarg]]
[[h2:blerg]]
[[h3:blorg]]
[[h4:blirg]]

With four or more headings Mikron creates a table of contents.

[[h1:Commands]]
By placing text in [[[]][ and ]] you can use Mikron commands. These are links to other pages, URLs or special instructions to Mikron.

[[h2:Escapes]]
If a command is a single character, then this character is inserted at the place of the command. So to use the [[[]] character type [[[]][[[]][[[]]]].

[[h2:Links]]
Mikron pages use ALL UPPERCASE NAMES and can contain only english letters and the underscore character (ie. the valid set of characters is ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_). Using a command which is a valid page name creates a link to that page. For example [[[]][FOO]] creates a link to the FOO page. If FOO has a title specified the FOO's title is displayed for the link's page, otherwise the Foo text will be used (that is the page's name with the first letter as uppercase and the rest as lowercase). To override the title use a colon after the page name, like [[[]][FOO:the Foo page]].

To create a link to a webpage, ftp site or email just use the URL as the command. For example [[[]][http://runtimelegend.com]] creates a link to [[http://runtimelegend.com]]. To use a title put a space (not a colon) after the URL like [[[]][http://runtimelegend.com Runtime Legend]] (for [[http://runtimelegend.com Runtime Legend]]). Mikron understands URLs beginning with http:, https:, ftp:, mailto:, news: and irc:. And magnet:. And possibly more in the future!

Interestingly, [[[]][http:/localpath/file.html]] will also work, for local links, the href will look like http:/localpath/file.html but the browser will cope (chrome anyway) (currently).

[[h2:Images]]
Use [[[]][img:url]] to load an image from the given url. The image will be inserted as a standalone block. To align the image with the text left or right use [[[]][limg:url]] (for left) or [[[]][rimg:url]] (right).

[[h2:Snippets]]
[[#]]time# will be replaced by a timestamp, like [2013-01-09 16:09:08].

[[h2:HTML]]
To insert raw HTML use [[[]][html:...]].
